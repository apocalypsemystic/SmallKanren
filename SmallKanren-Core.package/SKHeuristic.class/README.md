Heuristics are used to guide the SmallKanren search behavior. SKInterleaving represents the classic miniKanren interleaving search, and is used by default unless another search strategy is specified.

Each partial State keeps track of its place in the search space using a piece of state defined by the chosen Heuristic, and advanced by methods on that Heuristic that handle events such as expanding a conde, a lazy goal, or a conjunction.
