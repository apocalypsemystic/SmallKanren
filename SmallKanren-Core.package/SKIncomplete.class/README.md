A stream that will produce 0 or more answers. This stream type is only produced by fresh goals, which must delay execution in their branch to give other branches a chance to run, thereby preventing infinite loops in one branch from monopolizing the processor. Because fresh goals are rarely used (match is almost always more efficient), this stream mainly exists to allow more direct translation from the mental models of other minikanren dialects.
