Creates a fresh variable for each argument of its block and delays the computation once before executing the goal inside the block, to allow other branches of the search to run. Mostly unused as a subgoal (non top level) aside from simple programs and comparisons with other minikanren dialects. Match is usually more efficient. As the top level goal, however, the arguments to the block become the query variables for the entire computaiton.
